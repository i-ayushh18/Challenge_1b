Why? 9.2.3 Properties Physical properties Alkanes are almost non-polar molecules because of the covalent nature of C-C and C-H bonds and due to very little difference of electronegativity between carbon and hydrogen atoms. They possess weak van der Waals forces. Due to the weak forces, the first four members, C to C are gases, C to C 17 are liquids and those containing 18 carbon atoms or more are solids at 298 K. They are colourless and odourless. What do you think about solubility of alkanes in water based upon non-polar nature of alkanes? Petrol is a mixture of hydrocarbons and is used as a fuel for automobiles. Petrol and lower fractions of petroleum are also used for  dry cleaning of clothes to remove grease stains. On the basis of this observation, what do you think about the nature of the greasy substance? You are correct if you say that grease (mixture of higher alkanes) is non- Reprint 2025-26",
