      "refined_text": "of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2023” means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2023. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior-year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Overview Accenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions across Strategy & Consulting, Technology, Operations, Industry X and Song. We serve clients in three geographic markets: North America, Europe and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East). We combine our strength in technology and leadership in cloud, data and AI with unmatched industry experience, functional expertise and global delivery capability to help the world’s leading businesses, governments and other organizations build their digital core, optimize their operations, accelerate revenue growth and enhance citizen services—creating tangible value at speed and scale. Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, the overall inflationary environment and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which has impacted and may continue to impact our business. These conditions have slowed the pace and level of client spending for smaller contracts with a shorter duration, especially for our consulting services. From an industry perspective, we are also experiencing reduced demand particularly in our Communications, Media & Technology industry group. Key Metrics Key metrics for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 are included below. We have presented operating margin and diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP or “adjusted” basis to exclude the impact of $1,063 million in business optimization costs and, with respect to diluted earnings per share, the impact of a $253 million investment gain recorded during fiscal 2023. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Revenues of $64.1 billion, representing 4% growth in U.S. dollars and 8% growth in local currency; New bookings of $72.2 billion, an increase of 1% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currency; Operating margin of 13.7%, compared to 15.2% in fiscal 2022; adjusted operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 15.4%; Diluted earnings per share of $10.77, compared to $10.71 for fiscal 2022; adjusted earnings per share increased 9% to $11.67; and Cash returned to shareholders of $7.2 billion, including share purchases of $4.3 billion and dividends of $2.8 billion.

Client Solutions Group (“CSG”) — CSG offers branded PCs, including notebooks, desktops, and workstations and branded peripherals that include displays, docking stations, keyboards, mice, and webcam and audio devices, as well as third-party software and peripherals. CSG also includes services offerings, such as configuration, support and deployment, and extended warranties. Our major product categories within CSG are our commercial offerings and consumer offerings. Our CSG offerings are designed to optimize performance, reliability, manageability, design, and security for our customers and include on-device AI for greater end-user creativity and productivity. Our commercial portfolio provides our customers with solutions centered on flexibility to address their complex needs such as IT modernization, hybrid work transformation, and other critical areas. Our consumer portfolio primarily focuses on high-end consumer and gaming offerings, providing our customers with powerful performance, processing, and end-user experiences. Approximately 60% of CSG revenue is generated by sales to customers in the Americas, with the remaining portion derived from sales to customers in EMEA and APJ. Our other businesses, described below, primarily consist of our resale of standalone offerings of VMware LLC (formerly VMware, Inc. and individually and together with its subsidiaries, “VMware”), referred to as “VMware Resale,” and offerings of SecureWorks Corp. (“Secureworks”). These businesses are divested businesses or their offerings are no longer actively sold, and are not classified as reportable segments, either individually or collectively. Their operating results are reported within Corporate and other. VMware Resale includes our sale of standalone VMware offerings. On November 22, 2023, VMware was acquired by Broadcom, and subsequently announced changes to its go-to-market approach for VMware offerings that impacted our commercial relationship with VMware. On March 25, 2024, we terminated our Commercial Framework Agreement with VMware, which provided the framework under which we and VMware continued our commercial relationship following our spin-off of VMware on November 1, 2021. We no longer act as a distributor of Broadcom’s VMware standalone products and services, although we will continue to support customers that have purchased resale offerings sold in prior periods. We continue to integrate and embed certain VMware products and services with selected Dell Technologies’ offerings to end-users. The results of such offerings are reflected within CSG or ISG, depending upon the nature of the underlying offering sold. See Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for more information regarding the impact of Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware.",

Manufacturing and Materials We own manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Malaysia, China, Brazil, India, Poland, and Ireland. See “Item 2 — Properties” for information about our manufacturing and distribution facilities. We also utilize contract manufacturers throughout the world to manufacture or assemble our products under the Dell Technologies brand to provide operational flexibility, achieve cost efficiencies, deliver products faster, better serve our customers, and enhance our supply chain. When using contract manufacturers, we purchase components from suppliers and subsequently sell those components to the manufacturer. Our manufacturing process consists of assembly, software installation, functional testing, and quality control. We conduct operations utilizing a formal, documented quality management system to ensure that our products and services satisfy customer needs and expectations. Testing and quality control are also applied to components, parts, sub-assemblies, and systems obtained from third-party suppliers. Our quality management system is maintained through the testing of components, sub-assemblies, software, and systems at various stages in the manufacturing process. Quality control procedures also include a burn-in period for completed units after assembly, ongoing production reliability audits, failure tracking for early identification of production and component problems, and processing of information from customers obtained through services and support programs. This system is certified to the ISO 9001 International Standard that includes our global sites and organizations that design, manufacture, and service our products. Our order fulfillment, manufacturing, and test facilities are also certified to the ISO 9001 International Standard for quality management systems, the ISO 14001 International Standard for environmental management systems, the ISO 45001 International Standard for health and safety management systems, and the ISO 50001 International Standard for energy management systems. These internationally-recognized endorsements of ongoing quality, environmental, health and safety, and energy management are among the highest levels of certifications available. We also have implemented programs and methodologies to ensure that the quality of our designs, manufacturing, test processes, and supplier relationships are continually improved. We maintain a Supplier Code of Conduct, actively manage recycling processes for our returned products, and are certified by the Environmental Protection Agency as a Smartway Transport Partner. We purchase materials, supplies, product components, and products from a large number of qualified suppliers. In some cases, where multiple sources of supply are not available, we rely on a single source or a limited number of sources of supply if we believe it is advantageous to do so because of performance, quality, support, delivery, capacity, or price considerations. We believe that any disruption that may occur because of our dependence on single- or limited-source vendors would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Our Industry — Our use of single-source or limited-source suppliers may adversely affect the availability or timely delivery of some critical products or components.” for information about the risks associated with Dell Technologies’ use of single- or limited-source suppliers.",
